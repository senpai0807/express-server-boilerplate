# Express Server Boilerplate
This git serves as a boilerplate for that who are having a hard time creating an Express server. Within it includes a custom logger, uses middleware libraries such as cors, helmet, morgan, connect-rid, body-parser, compression, errorhandler, and response-time, and it utilizes worker_threads to load balance the traffic, as well as supports GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE requests. This git also includes how routes are structured and I've included a /token route that generates a JWT token.
